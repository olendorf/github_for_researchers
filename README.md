A workshop for researchers to use Git and Github. You can access the web content by clicking the link un the About section.

The step by step tutorial is on the Tutorial tab. In this case the slides are really just introductory, most of the content is in the tutorial. The instructors notes contain additional information along with the bibliography


The content is all developed using GitHub pages and Jekyll using a framework I developed called [apprentice](https://github.com/olendorf/apprentice).
