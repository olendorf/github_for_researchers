## Git Is Dominant
<div class="row">
    <div class ="one column">
        <figure class>
          <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/slides/git_interest.png" alt="Just a sample image"/>
        </figure>
    </div>
</div>

NOTE:

- Git has become the dominant versioning system quickly
- THis pretty much means you have to use git if you want to be interoperable
