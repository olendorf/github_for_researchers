## Slide 2

This is the second slide. And it's just another file inside the _slides directory.

It is identified as slide 2, because it has its order defined as as such
in the front matter.

```
    ---
    
    # Previous slide was less than 2
    
    order: 2
    
    # Next slide is greater than 2
    
    ---

```
