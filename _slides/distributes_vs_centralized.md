NOTE:

- Centralized systems are also often called server-client
  - Clients must talk only with the server
  - SErvers pass information to clients
  - web sites for instance
  - server handles security and rules
- Before Git most versioning systems were centralized.
- Distributed systems are often called peer-to-peer
  - Anyone can talk to anyone
  - each node handles its own security and rules
- Decentralized systems, also called coordinated systems
  - Its really a more organized distributed system
  - Clients tend to talk to "Hubs"
  - Hubs are just clients but are elevated by convention
  - Its more based on culture colaboration than rules
  - Git with Github and the ecosystem are decentralized.
