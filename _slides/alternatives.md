<div class="row">
  <div class="two-col left">

  
    <figure>
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/slides/gitlab.png" alt="GitLab logo"/>
    </figure>
  
  </div>
  
  <div class="two-col right">
  
    <figure>
      <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/slides/bitbucket.png" alt="Bitbucket Logo"/>
    </figure>
  
  </div>
</div>

NOTE: 

- GitLab
  - Started as an open source knock off of github
  - Offers hosted and host your own
  - Host your own is relatively easy
    - Need a server (could be aws)
    - Need a little technical skill 
  - Useful if you can't use a cloud service
  - or don't want to
-Bitbucket
  - Similar to GitHub as well
  - Integrates with Trello
  - Integrates with Jira (same owner)
- GitHub is where most people are
  - Easier to share
  - Probably more integrations overall
- All are workable
