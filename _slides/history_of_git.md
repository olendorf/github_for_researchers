      <li>Developed in 2005 by Linus Torvalds</li>

        <li>Simplicity</li>
        <li>Non-linear development</li>
        <li>Distributed</li>

NOTE: 

- Linus was driven to develop Git when BitKeeper decided not to give him free service for the development of Linux
- Other versioning systems, CVS, Subversion, were slow and didn't scale to large projects with distributed teams
  - They focus on differences between files
  - Git takes snapshots of the entire file system.
