In addition to what we have covered, GitHub provides a number of useful services that compliment its core versioning and collaboration service. Many of these services
are provided by GitHub, such as their Wiki, static web sites, projects and analytics. Perhaps, if not more imporantly, they have an [open API](https://developer.github.com/v3/)
(a way for other computers to communicate, via the web with GitHub) that others have used to build websites to provide additional services. 

In the next few units we'll explore some of these services. However, there are many more out there to be discovered!
