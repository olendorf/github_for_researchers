### Help With Apprentice

If you have a question or problem with Apprentice (or are unsure), just submit an Issue 
in the [Apprentice Repository](https://github.com/olendorf/apprentice/issues).
If you would like to propose changes or additions, feel free to do the
standard fork/pull request route. New layouts, themes are especially welcome,
also adding support for other presentation engines.

### Resource for Jekyll and Liquid 

There are lots of resources for Jekyll and liquid. Usually a web search with 
your problem or question will yield an answer. You can also visit the [Jeklyll
website](https://jekyllrb.com/) or the 
[Liquid Documentation](https://help.shopify.com/en/themes/liquid) on Shopify.

### GitHub Pages

If you are publishing to GitHub pages, a web search will still often find
an answer for you. You can also visit their 
[documenation](https://pages.github.com/).
