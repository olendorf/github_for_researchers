  Git becomes an incredibly powerful collaboration and publishing tool when coupled with GitHub.
  While it may seem confusing at first, GitHub is really just another Git repository. Git has
  the ability to communicate with any other repository built right in. GitHub just provides a web 
  interface and many other services to help manage and publish our projects.
  
  At this point we refer to the Git repository on our local computer as a *_local_* repository. Other copies 
  of our work on other computers are called *_remote_* repositories. By convention, we 
  work with our collabortors by coordinating through a single remote repository, in this case GitHub. 
  
  In this unit we create a copy of our local repository to GitHub by **pushing** it. We edit it
  using the GitHub interface, then **pull** it back into our local repository.
