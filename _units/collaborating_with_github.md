  One of the biggest benefits of GitHub is how it facilitates collaboration on a number
  of different levels. Over the years, a culture has grown up around GitHub that specifies 
  several conventions that facilitate collaboration.
  
  In this section, we will learn how to copy repositories, add collaborators
  to our own repositories and even collaborate with people we may not know at all.
