Providing your learners and instructors with an idea of what skills they need 
before they take the workshop and what they will learn is important to 
helping everyone get the most out of the workshop. Apprentice pulls these
from data files in the `_data/prereqs.yml` and `_data/objectives` directories.
Just add a line for each prerequisite or objective in the appropriate file.

```yml
  # In _data/prereqs.yml
  - Update these in `_data/prereqs.yml`.
  - Familiarity with git and GitHub is helpful
  - Minimum level of comfort with the command line may help
  # - Ability to uncomment these lines
  
  # In _data/objectives.yml
  - Update this in `_data/objectives.yml`
  - Create your own apprentice workshop
  - Here are some more
  - Microdosing occupy glossier
  - You need a little dummy text for your mockup
```

If you modify these in your instance and go to the home page you should
see the changes.
